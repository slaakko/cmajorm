            Cmajor Compiler Organization
        </h1>

        <p>
            The Cmajor compiler follows traditional compiler organization having a front-end and a back-end.
            The front-end drives the compilation process and generates intermediate code.
            The back-end optimizes the intermediate code and generates machine code from it.
            In addition the front-end utilizes an archiver that bundles object code files into libraries
            and a linker that produces executable programs from the object code and library files.
        </p>

        <p>
            At present there's one front-end written in C++ and another one planned to be written in Cmajor.
            There's two back-ends, <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> back-end that is the real one,
            and another, System X, that is an experimental one written in Cmajor.
            LLVM can produce code for many platforms and computer architectures,
            but currently Cmajor outputs only x86_64 code for Windows and Linux.
            The System X back-end produces MMIX-based assembly code for a virtual machine.
        </p>

        <p>
            The front-end has four main components:
            <ul>
                <li>parser,</li>
                <li>symbol table,</li>
                <li>binder and</li> 
                <li>code generator</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>
            Parser
        </h2>

        <p>
            The <a href="reference/sngcm/cmparser/cmparser.html">parser</a> component is made using <a href="https://slaakko.github.io/soulng/contents.html">SoulNG</a> parser generator tool.
            It produces a <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/ast.html">tree</a> of objects for each syntax element in a Cmajor source file.
            Each kind of syntax element, be it an identifier, literal, variable, function or type, is represented by a class that 
            is derived from the <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_Node_7FDC87EBEBE372FAA4360E17F122F6028A1505D6.html">Node</a> class.
            Syntax tree nodes can be written to and read from a binary stream, cloned and they accept a
            <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_Visitor_EE4D58A199693C26BFFAD637A3ADC818BC5994FC.html">visitor</a>.
            The phases of compilation following the parsing phase walk the syntax tree node object hierarchy using a concrete visitor derived from the base visitor class.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many kinds of syntax tree nodes.
            Primitive ones such as <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_IdentifierNode_4CE99E9F7A7A909CE85CE1E7ED4A63A5060B83E3.html">identifier</a> are derived directly from the
            node class. They just contain the data for the element. There are also composite syntax tree nodes that have child nodes.
            The <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_UnaryNode_165135A5C7753F52B4F177BA0F0E4222CB08456A.html">unary</a> nodes have one child node.
            Concrete examples of unary nodes are nodes for expressions taking one operand. Each kind of unary operator is represented by such a class derived from the unary node class.
            Similarly each binary operator is represented by a class derived from the <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_BinaryNode_3126E45E075D8E51330FC7DF648DA56ED7E10D9D.html">binary</a> node class.
            Nodes having arbitrary many child nodes, such as <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_NamespaceNode_FCE3319C12CB53B9DE678E1E74EA6C7698B7CD4C.html">namespace</a> nodes,
            have a <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_NodeList_92D32F9C7F3DBA6ECEC0B05A7D7CF10C01D6FCEB.html">node list</a>.

            Symbol table
        </h2>

        <p">
            The <a href="reference/symbols/symbols.html">symbol table</a> component collects information about program entities.
            In syntax tree each identifier has its own node despite of its value.
            In contrast in the symbol table each symbol except class template specialization symbol is unique.

            The key classes in this component are

                    class that creates symbols from syntax tree nodes and insert them into symbol table.
                    There is a symbol for each class, function, compound statement, parameter, variable, typedef, delegate, enumerated type, enumeration constant
                    and constant node.
                </li>

            </p>

            <p>
                The information kept in the symbol table depends on the program entity:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All symbols have name and mangled name.
                        The name of a symbol is the value of the identifier used in declaration of the program entity.
                        The mangled name of a symbol identifies the program entity in intermediate code files.
                        It consists of only Latin letters, digits and underscores and ends with hexadecimal SHA-1 hash of the full name of the entity.
                        All symbols have also
                        <a href="reference/symbols/html/content/enum_SymbolFlags_008C1051F1FC28E5BA1D0762EA9AD5BF40BA0B17.html">flags</a>,

                At the end of compilation of a program or library module, the contents of the module, meaning exportable symbols and their the externally visible attributes,
                is written to a module file that has a <em>.cmm</em> extension.
                At the start of a compilation of a program or library module the contents of the modules it references to are read from their module files.

                Binder
            </h2>

            <p>
                The task of the <a href="reference/binder/binder.html">binder</a> component is to combine syntax with symbols and to create bound node trees
                from which intermediate code can be generated.
                After creating syntax trees from the source files and creating symbols from the syntax trees, the front-end completes the symbols with type information.
                The <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_TypeBinder_197D6C7822958FE5DD6F6B43DDE787A9FA490EEA.html">type binder</a> visits syntax trees and
                uses the <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_TypeResolver_2CB187B7C01DC112ECF07B8D0C87E4AF50BCFF1A.html">type resolver</a> to
                look up identifiers that should represent types from the symbol table. The type resolver also creates
                <a href="reference/symbols/html/content/class_ClassTemplateSpecializationSymbol_F0BC1A28739F39F0DA3BC5C1405A607BF1DFC8EA.html">class template specialization</a>
                symbols from <a href="reference/sngcm/ast/html/content/class_TemplateIdNode_511FF4648199D13B43B12A897052E66766561252.html">template id</a> nodes when needed.
                The type binder resolves:
                <ul>
                    <li>the return type of a function or delegate</li>
                    <li>the type of the base class of a class type</li>
                    <li>the declared type of a typedef</li>
                    <li>the type of a parameter, variable or constant</li>
                    <li>the underlying type of an enumerated type</li>
                </ul>
                The second task of the type binder is to evaluate constant expressions. For this it uses a static
                <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_Evaluator_4B7670893CEE707FB594A365EDC98F228E04C2F5.html">evaluator</a>.
                The result of evaluation is a value derived from the <a href="reference/symbols/html/content/class_Value_D656BD8E5EC910AF6747A38C3979A4A9B1E41ED4.html">value</a> class.
            </p>

            <p>
                After binding types the control branches to multiple threads and the compilation of each compile unit is done in parallel from now on.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next phase is binding statements and expressions.
                The <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_StatementBinder_9ABCC30A844E1A4C1BE61777BAAE98FBBA33A6BD.html">statement binder</a> visits the
                body of each function and creates <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundStatement_FA468BD98D7521F6E353AC55182B34AD7D55D8A7.html">bound statements</a>
                from the corresponding syntax statements.
                It also binds each expression using the <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_ExpressionBinder_C0C9CF3C7A3FAD1C9CAD7E66177E8932F8FC37BD.html">expression binder</a>.
                The expression binder creates <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundExpression_6C13A7CD518141FC69CADA397796946086EEA452.html">bound expressions</a>
                from syntax expressions. Each bound expression has a type that is represented as a pointer to a type symbol.
                Most bound expressions contain also a pointer to the symbol that corresponds the syntax tree node from which the bound node is created from:
                <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundLocalVariable_A57A3CCE331BFEC9A961AA545EA665CA0BE43FD1.html">bound local variable</a> has
                a <a href="reference/symbols/html/content/class_LocalVariableSymbol_F5A9F74EEFC0001129616C5EEBCFE3B2DFC74FCF.html">local variable symbol</a>,
                and <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundConstant_4F99952EEB608967A62DFA4EB371782CD2C2C305.html">bound constant</a> has a

            </p>

            <p>
                Major part of expression binding is devoted to overload resolution.
                To resolve a function call, the
                <a href="reference/binder/html/content/namespace_binder_C711B7605339DC3A9E128C1E622E7D9A4629C97D.html#function_ResolveOverload_274F866B0477129B5B456EC74D2549E01F146D85">ResolveOverload</a>
                function is called with the group name of the function to call and bound expression arguments.
                It returns a <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundFunctionCall_3B6FF42595EC5C47E14802245CBCB5F47F5F3EAC.html">bound function call</a>
                that contains a pointer to the symbol of the called function.
                Naturally all function call expressions are represented as bound function calls but also construction, copying and moving values,
                expressions containing unary and binary operators, and array element access are represented as such as well.
                For such operations the symbol contained in the bound function call is of type derived from the generic
                <a href="reference/symbols/html/content/class_FunctionSymbol_5AC1C26A9572181B3E31247997BF40453B22EDEF.html">function symbol</a> class.
            </p>

            <p>
                After resolving a function call expression to a function symbol to call, the compiler checks if the function symbol is a <strong>constexpr</strong>
                function or a compile time primitive function such as length of an array or string literal.
                When this is the case, the compiler tries to evaluate the value of the function at compile time using static
                <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_Evaluator_4B7670893CEE707FB594A365EDC98F228E04C2F5.html">evaluator</a>.
                If it succeeds the function call is replaced by a
                <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundLiteral_DF1E22194FB48EAFA2C4993DC33E08DF24AF2F68.html">bound literal</a> that
                contains the evaluated <a href="reference/symbols/html/content/class_Value_D656BD8E5EC910AF6747A38C3979A4A9B1E41ED4.html">value</a>.
                If the static evaluation fails, the value of the function is computed at run-time as usual.
            </p>

            <p>
                The binder component creates a <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundCompileUnit_E99BC7539B5239DF3A33DC3D613FE1D188A0A9E1.html">bound compile unit</a>
                in the beginning of compilation of a source file and it is also the result of this compilation.
                To support the compilation process, mainly overload resolution, a bound compile unit contains various repositories:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_ClassTemplateRepository_8091371C094F17B8769F636AA4554A153D57D624.html">class template repository</a>
                        is used for instantiating member functions of a class template.
                        When the type resolver creates a class template specialization symbol, it initially uses the class template repository
                        to bind <em>signatures</em> of the member functions of the class template.
                        The member functions are not <em>instantiated</em> until they are needed, that is: called. The instantiation processs is triggered by overload resolution.
                        The class template repository coordinates the instantiation process and contains the symbols of the instantiated member functions.
                        The instantiations themselves go to the bound compile unit.
                        When instantiating a member function of a class template, the class template repository uses the symbol creator, the type binder and the statement binder to
                        compile the body of the function.

                Code generator
            </h2>

            <p>
                The task of a code generator is to go through a bound compile unit and generate intermediate code from it.
                There are three code generators in the Cmajor front-end:
                one for <a href="reference/codegenwin/html/content/class_WindowsCodeGenerator_5CB85FB67BB4C01F571B8A928810DBE31840C4F5.html">Windows</a>,
                one for <a href="reference/codegenlinux/html/content/class_LinuxCodeGenerator_96D307C65FA858021AA104296621E87B504D8540.html">Linux</a> and
                one for <a href="reference/codegensx/html/content/class_SystemXCodeGenerator_DE287C9679CDC0753891962F51921862AF0B4632.html">System X</a>.
                The Windows and Linux code generators generate <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM instructions</a> and the
                System X code generator generate <a href="reference/cmsxi/html/content/class_Instruction_31E399AEA14ADF6E2D4DF9E2AC2EB3771E5E58AD.html">System X instructions</a>.
                The difference between the Windows and the Linux code generator is in implementation of exception handling.
                The Windows code generator implements the Visual C++ exception handling ABI and the the Linux code generator implements the Itanium exception handling ABI.
                The Windows and Linux code generators use the <a href="reference/cmllvm/html/content/class_Emitter_EFF99B195E35C6E87D7677FFB24ECB1F971CE9A0.html">cmllvm emitter</a>
                for creating intermediate instructions and the System X code generator use the
                <a href="reference/cmsxbe/html/content/class_Emitter_0B6D71D122C9C4AEF63343CD3FD27FEAA0BDF75B.html">cmsxbe emitter </a> for this task.
                Both emitters derive from the abstract <a href="reference/ir/html/content/class_Emitter_154396B281E1F2C3ECA7612F1A3AD2E408E7D595.html">ir emitter</a> class,
                whose interface is a superset of the functionality implemented by both concrete emitters.
            </p>

            <p>
                When visiting each kind of <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundStatement_FA468BD98D7521F6E353AC55182B34AD7D55D8A7.html">bound statement</a>,
                the code generators create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block">basic blocks</a> that contain code for bound expressions and jumps between the basic blocks that correspond the control flow.
                The <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundExpression_6C13A7CD518141FC69CADA397796946086EEA452.html">bound expressions</a>
                implement two basic operations defined in the <a href="reference/ir/html/content/class_GenObject_58B5CE43FA7DE3F0DCCA4882DA8ADB648134410A.html">GenObject</a> interface:
                the <em>load</em> operation that produce side effects, generates a value and pushes it to the
                <a href="reference/ir/html/content/class_ValueStack_0032454A09E37AB037BC01A9EA549EFC362C7CDA.html">value stack</a>
                of an emitter, and the <em>store</em> operation that pops a value from the value stack and stores it to a location of the bound expression.
                The store operation of those bound expressions that are not lvalues generate an error by throwing an exception.
            </p>

            <p>
                Function calls and operations on primitive, derived and class types are all implemented as
                <a href="reference/binder/html/content/class_BoundFunctionCall_3B6FF42595EC5C47E14802245CBCB5F47F5F3EAC.html">bound function calls</a> that
                call the the virtual <em>generate call</em> member function of a contained function symbol that represents the operation.

            <p>
                The front-end consists of these <a href="reference/compiler-projects.html">modules</a>.

            <h3 id="is-and-as-expressions">Is and As Expressions</h3>

            <p>
                The implementation of <b>is</b> and <b>as</b> expressions is based on a scheme invented by Michael Gibbs and Bjarne Stroustrup
                and described in their article <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/fast_dynamic_casting.pdf">Fast dynamic casting</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each polymorphic class in Cmajor has a unique 128-bit identifier that is a product of prime number keys.
                The prime number key of the class is based on the level of the class in the class hierarchy.
                Ultimate base classes are assigned keys 2, 3, 5, etc., and the leaf classes of the class hierarchy have the largest keys.
                The identifier of a class is the product of the key of itself, the key of its base class, the key of its ancestor class, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we have these class identifiers, the test whether a polymorphic class A is the same class or derived from the class B
                becomes a simple modulo operation: <em>classIdOf(A) % classIdOf(B) == 0</em> <=> A is same or derived from B.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 128-bit identifier of a class is stored to the virtual method table of the class at index 0.
                The class identifier is initially zero and dynamically initialized by calling the runtime library.
                The runtime library looks up the class identifier from a hash table by using a 16-byte type identifier (UUID) of the class as a key
                and stores the nonzero 128-bit class identifier to the virtual method table index 0.
                The 16-byte type identifier (UUID) is initialized by the compiler and stored to the virtual method table at index 2 in 64-bit units.
                The hash table lookup is needed only first time. In the future the class id is found in the VMT at index 0.
