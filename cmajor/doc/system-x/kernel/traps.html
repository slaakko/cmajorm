    <h1>System X Kernel Traps</h1>

	<p>
		System X <a href="../il/sxil_reference.html#trap"><span class="kw">trap</span></a> instruction has three fixed arguments and 
		in addition up to four arguments supplied using the <a href="../il/sxil_reference.html#arg">arg</a> instruction.
		The first three arguments are bytes that define the kernel trap to be called
		and the rest are arguments to that trap function passed in registers 
		<span class="kw">ax</span>, <span class="kw">bx</span>, <span class="kw">cx</span> and
		<span class="kw">dx</span>. If the trap function returns a value it is returned in the 
		<span class="kw">ax</span> register. If the trap fails, the <span class="kw">ax</span> register 
		will contain value -1 otherwise the return value will be nonnegative.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Currently the first and the third byte arguments have zero value and the second argument value
		determine the virtual operating system function to be called.
	</p>
