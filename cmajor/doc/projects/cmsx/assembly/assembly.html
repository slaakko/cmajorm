    <h1>2 Assembly Language Tutorial</h1>

    <p>
        System X assembly language is based on the instruction set of
        the mythical <a href="mmix/fasc1.pdf">MMIX</a> computer architecture invented by Donald E. Knuth.
        The details are a bit different, though, because full compatibility with the original
        was not possible and it was not aimed either.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Hello
    </h2>

    <p>
        Let's take a look at the classical hello world program written in
        System X assembly language:
    </p>

    <pre>
 1 // ===================================================
 2 // hello
 3 //
 4 // Writes text "Hello, world!" to the standard output.
 5 // On entry ax=argc and bx=argv.
 6 // On exit ax contains the exit code of the program.
 7 // ===================================================

 9             EXTERN main
10  
11 .CODE
12  
13 main        FUNC
14             STO fp,sp,0
15             SET fp,sp
16             INCL sp,1*8
17             LDOU ax,hello
18             CALL $0,puts
19             BN ax,@0
20             SET ax,0
21             JMP @1
22 @0          SET ax,1
23 @1          SET sp,fp
24             LDO fp,sp,0
25             RET
26 main        ENDF
27 
28 .DATA
29
30 hello       OCTA message
31 message     BYTE "Hello, world!",10,0
    </pre>

    <p>
        System X assembly files are UTF-8 encoded text files that
        have zero or more lines consisting of three fields separated by spaces,
        a label field, an instruction field and an operand field.
        Some or all of these fields can be empty.
        The first field is the label field that starts from the first column.
        A label can start with a letter, or one of the characters @, : or _.
        If the first character of a line that is not a space or period, is
        not a label character either, the whole line is taken as a comment,
        so according to this, lines 1-7 are comments.
        Typical comments start with // as in C++ or % as in TeX and postscript.
        Semicolon cannot be used, because it is used to separate many instructions entered in the same line.
        Comments can occur also at the end of instruction lines.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next field that starts with the first character after the label field that is not a space
        is the instruction field. The instruction can be an MMIX instruction or a pseudo-instruction
        that is meaningful to the assembler. The EXTERN instruction at line 9 declares that
        operand symbols separated by commas can be called or referenced from outside of this assembly file.
        It is not a standard MMIX instruction or pseudo-instruction, but an extension supported only
        by the cmsx tools. Its purpose is to communicate to the linker that listed symbols are visible
        outside of this assembly file.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the line starts with symbol .CODE, as in line 11, it turns the assembler to "code" mode, and if it is
        .DATA, it turns it to the "data" mode. These are also extensions to the stardard MMIX assembly
        language. Assembly of a file starts with the .CODE mode so strictly speaking the first .CODE
        instruction is not necessary. In .CODE mode the instruction are assembled to the
        text segment of the program, and in the .DATA mode to the data segment of the program.
        The text segment begins at virtual address #0000000000000000 though the first 4K is left undefined
        so that trying to load or store from or to the address 0 will cause a page fault handled by the kernel.
        The data segment begins at virtual address #2000000000000000.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fuctions in cmsx assembly language are decorated with pseudo-instructions FUNC and ENDF,
        as in lines 13 and 26. These are extensions to the standard MMIX whose purpose is to allow
        the linker to remove unused functions from the resulting executable, although this feature
        is not yet implemented. Next come ordinary instruction lines. An ordinary instruction line consists of an
        optional label field, an instruction field that is never empty, and then an optional operand field listing
        operands of the instruction separated by commas. Note that there can be no white space between the operands.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next three instructions at lines 14, 15 and 16 establish a stack frame for a function.
        First the contents of the frame pointer, MMIX global register $249, is stored to the top of the
        stack. Then the value of the stack pointer, which is represented as an MMIX global register $250,
        is set to the frame pointer, so that possible parameters and local variables can be refererred as
        fp+8, fp+16, etc. Finally the stack pointer is incremented by the size of the stack frame,
        in this case simply 1 octabyte. On the contrary to many computer architectures, the
        stack for cmsx programs grows onward, not downward. The stack segment begins at virtual
        address #6000000000000000.
    </p>

    <p>
        The LDOU instruction, load octa unsigned, at line 17, retrieves the start address of the
        message into the ax register, an MMIX global register $255. In the cmsx function call convention,
        first five function arguments are passed in registers, ax, bx, cx, dx, and ex, and the
        rest in the stack. The names of the global registers, ax, $255, bx, $254, cx, $253, dx, $252,
        ex, $251, sp, $250 and fp, $249 are predefined by the cmsx assembler and can be used instead of the
        global register numbers in all cmsx assembly files.
    </p>

    <p>
        The CALL instruction at line 18 is a nonstandard extension renamed from the PUSHGO MMIX instruction
        because its semantics differ from the PUSHGO. The CALL $X,A instruction first pushes local registers
        $0, $1, ..., $X to the top of the stack, and then an octabyte with the value of the number of
        registers pushed, X, is pushed. Then the value of MMIX rL special register that contains the number of
        current local registers, and finally the return address, the address of the instruction coming
        after the CALL instruction are pushed to the top of the stack.
        The stack pointer is incremented accordingly, the rL receives value 0,
        and then the control is transferred to the function starting at address A,
        in this case the <em>puts</em> library function.
    </p>

    <p>
        By convention the return value of a cmsx function is put to the global register ax, so the BN instruction,
        branch if negative, at line 19, tests if the value of the ax register is less than zero and if so,
        branches to the local label @0 to indicate a failure. Local labels are also extension to the standard MMIX.
        The SET ax,0 instruction at line 20, the JMP @1 instruction at line 21 and the SET ax,1
        set zero to return value register ax, jump to local label @1 and set one to return value register ax
        respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end of the function SET sp,fp instruction at line 23 removes parameters and local variables from
        the stack and LDO fp,sp,0, load octa instruction at line 24 gets the old value of the frame pointer.
        The RET instruction at line 25 is renamed from the standard MMIX POP instruction for the same reason
        as the PUSHGO is renamed to CALL. The RET pops the return address, the old value of the rL register,
        the number of registers, X, and the old values of registers $X,$X-1,..,$1,$0 from the stack.
        The stack pointer is decremented accordingly and then the control is transferred to the calling function
        to the position indicated by the return address. The function is ended by the ENDF instruction that
        takes no operands.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the .DATA mode, starting from the line 28, only pseudo-instructions STRUCT, ENDS, OCTA, TETRA, WYDE and BYTE can be used.
        The OCTA defines octabytes, eight-byte entities, TETRA defines four-byte entities, WYDE two-byte entities and
        BYTE bytes, UTF-8 encoded strings and characters that are all assembled as bytes.
        An operand of an OCTA instruction can be defined outside of this assembly file, but the assembler must be able to
        evaluate operands of TETRA, WYDE and BYTE in place. The STRUCT and ENDS instructions not used in this program
        are extensions that tell the linker about the bounds of data records.

    <h2>
        Assembling Hello
    </h2>

    <p>
        System X assembly files have by convention <strong>.s</strong> extension standing for <em>symbolic</em>.
        To assemble <strong>hello.s</strong> file that contains the hello world program, change to the
        <strong>cmajor/projects/cmsx/test/assembly</strong> directory and enter the following command:
    </p>

    <pre>
        cmsxas hello.s
    </pre>

    <p>
        If the command succeeds it assembles the <strong>hello.s</strong> to a binary file <strong>hello.o</strong> that
        contains the object code for the hello program, otherwise the error message is printed to the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you prefer some message to be printed to the screen also in the successful case, enter command
    </p>

    <pre>
        cmsxas -v hello.s
    </pre>

    <p>
        <strong>-v</strong> option stands for <em>verbose</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To see usage, enter command
    </p>

    <pre>
        cmsxas -h
    </pre>

    <h2>
        Linking Hello
    </h2>

    <p>
        To link <strong>hello.o</strong> to an executable program type command
    </p>

    <pre>
        cmsxlink hello.o -o=hello
    </pre>

    <p>
        If the command succeeds it links the <strong>hello.o</strong> with the startup routine <strong>Main.o</strong> and the runtime library <strong>System.a</strong>
        and produces an executable file whose name is given in the <strong>-o</strong> option. If no <strong>-o</strong> option is used the executable will be named <strong>a.out</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To see some printing on the screen enter command
    </p>

    <pre>
        cmsxlink -v hello.o -o=hello    
    </pre>

    <p>
        This lists the input files that are linked:
    </p>

    <pre>
        Cmajor System X Linker version 0.1.0
        > C:/cmajor/projects/cmsx/cmsxrt/Main.o
        > C:/cmajor/projects/cmsx/cmsxrt/System.a
        > C:/cmajor/projects/cmsx/test/assembly/hello.o
        ==> C:/cmajor/projects/cmsx/test/assembly/hello
    </pre>

    <p>
        Option <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>--help</strong> prints the usage and lists the possible options of the link command.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Building libraries
    </h2>

    <p>
        There's also an archiver to build libraries of object files.
        To build an archive, enter command:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <strong>cmsxar</strong> <em>object1.o</em> <em>object2.o</em> <em>-o=library.a</em>
    </pre>

    <h2>
        Executing Hello
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <strong>hello</strong> program can be executed by giving the command
    </p>

    <pre>
        cmsx hello
    </pre>

    <p>
        This finally prints the famous message
    </p>

    <pre>
        Hello, world!
    </pre>

    <p>
        To see the exit code of the program give a <strong>-v</strong> option before the program name:
    </p>

    <pre>
        cmsx -v hello
    </pre>

    <p>
        This produces the following output:
    </p>

    <pre>
        Cmajor System X kernel version 0.1.0 booting, done.
        running program 'hello' as process 0
        Hello, world!
        machine exit.
        program exited with code 0.
    </pre>

    <p>
        If the program to be executed takes parameters add them after the program name:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <strong>cmsx</strong> <em>program</em> <em>--opt1</em> <em>--opt2</em> <em>arg1</em> <em>arg2</em>
    </pre>
