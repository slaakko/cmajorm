    <h1>The Spring Software Diagram Designer</h1>

    <p>
        Spring is a graphical tool for creating class and object diagrams.
        Here's a picture of the main window of spring:

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    
    <p>
        Spring has ten tools:
        
        <ol>
            <li>The arrow tool is for selecting diagram elements, moving elements and selections and executing operations on them.</li>
            <li>The hand tool is for setting the visible a part of a large diagram.</li>
            <li>The class tool is for adding a new class to the diagram.</li>
            <li>The object tool is for adding a new object to the diagram.</li>
            <li>The note tool is for adding a pseudocode note to the diagram.</li>
            <li>The inheritance tool is for adding an inheritance relationship between two classes.</li>
            <li>The aggregation tool is for adding an aggregation relationship between two classes.</li>
            <li>The reference tool is for adding a reference relationship between two classes or two objects.</li>
            <li>The create instance tool is for adding a create instance relationship between two classes.</li>
            <li>The attach note tool is for attaching a pseudocode note to an operation of a class.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Selections</h2>
    
    <p>
        The diagram may have two kinds of selections: an "element" selection and a "rectangle" selection.
        The element selection consists of individual diagram elements. 
        You can add and remove elements from the selection by holding the control key down while clicking an element.
        A rectangle selection is created by clicking a part of a diagram and holding down the left mouse button while dragging with the mouse.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Operations</h2>
    
    <p>
        By clicking an element or selection with the right mouse button shows a context menu of operations that can applied to that kind of element or elements.
        <ul>
        <li>When an element selection contains multiple classes, objects or notes, you can align them or space them evenly horizontally or vertically.</li>
        <li>The lines of a single relationship element can be straightent.</li>
        <li>Selected elements can be deleted.</li>
        <li>An image consisting of the selected elements can be saved to a file.</li>
        <li>The properties of a single diagram element can be changed.</li>
        <li>Multiple inheritance relationships can be combined to a single one, and a single combined inheritance relationship can be split to distinct relationships.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
