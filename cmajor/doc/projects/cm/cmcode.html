        Cmajor Code
    </h1>
	
	<p>
		Cmajor Code is a new IDE for Cmajor for Windows.
		It is written in the Cmajor programming language.
		You can edit, compile, debug, and run programs from cmcode.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Editing
	</h2>

	<p>
		This first version provides just basic editing of source files. No special fancy features.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Compiling
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		cmcode provides compiling of projects and solutions by launching
		<strong>cmbs</strong>, a build server written in C++.
		The build server contains Cmajor compilers for LLVM and C++ backends.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Debugging
	</h2>

	<p>
		When a program has been compiled using the C++ backend,
		it can be debugged from cmcode. The debugging functionality 
		is provided by running <a href="../../tools/cmdb/cmdb.html">cmdb</a>, a debugger that
		drives GDB. The debugger is a C++ program.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Running
	</h2>

	<p>
		Programs can be run from cmcode by selecting Debug | Start Without Debugging menu item.
		The input and output of a console program is directed to the Console window included in the IDE.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Many instances
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		You can have up to five instances of cmcode running at the same time.
		The IDE obtains unique TCP port numbers from <strong>cmpms</strong>, a port map server,
		that has a range of free port numbers. The port number range that the port map server delivers is 
		in the <strong>C:\cmajor\config\cmpm.config.xml</strong> configuration file.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The port number server can be stopped and restarted from the Cmajor Port Map Monitor that
		can be started from the IDE by selecting View | Port Map.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Reference
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Reference documentation generated from the source code of the cmcode and libraries it uses is <a href="reference/index.html">here</a>.
