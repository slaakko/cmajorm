    <h1>cmupd</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>cmupd</strong> is a tool for converting user projects that use Cmajor version 3.2.0 or earlier APIs to use APIs of the current 3.3.0 version.
    </p>

    <pre>
        Usage: cmupd [options] { SOLUTION.cms | PROJECT.cmp | SOURCEFILE.cm }
        Options:
        --help | -h
            Print help and exit.
        --verbose | -v
            Be verbose.
        --commit  | c
            Make changes to sources.
            If run without the --commit flag, only shows what changes would be made without actually making the changes.
    </pre>

    <p>
        The tool may be able to convert source code to use new APIs of the following changed libraries:
        <ul>
            <li>System.Dom</li>
            <li>System.Xml</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The tool may not be able to convert all source code to use new APIs of the following changed libraries,
        because APIs have changed so much or changes could not be automated:
        <ul>
            <li>System.Text.Parsing: new <strong>soulng</strong> parser generator used, this library has been replaced with the System.Parsing and System.Lex libraries.
            Need to update .parser files and regenerate parsers with the new tool.</li>
            <li>System.Text.Parsing.CodeDom: this library has been replaced with the Cm.Ast library that is in the projects/cm directory.</li>
            <li>System.Text.RegularExpressions: some manual changes needed</li>
            <li>System.XPath: some manual changes needed</li>
            <li>System.Net.Http: some manual changes needed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        If run without the --commit flag, prints the source lines that would be changed without actually making changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        When run with the --commit flag, renames an old source file that need to be changed from <em>foo.cm</em> to <em>foo.cm.000</em> and
        generates changed source file with name <em>foo.cm</em>.
