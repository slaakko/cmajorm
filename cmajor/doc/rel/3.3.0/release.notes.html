<h1>Cmajor 3.3.0 for Windows x64 and Linux</h1>

<h2>Release notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Bug fix: Path.MakeCanonical now converts a drive letter to upper case.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: The following construct generated invalid code:</p>

<p>class A
{
}</p>

<p>class B : A
{
}</p>

<p>void main()
{
    System.Collections.List&lt;A<em>> x;
    B</em> b;
    x.Add(b);
}</p>

<p>Now fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: The following construct generated invalid code:</p>

<p>class A
{
}</p>

<p>class B : A
{
}</p>

<p>void foo<T>(const T&amp; x)
{
}</p>

<p>void main()
{
    B* b;
    foo&lt;A*>(b);
}</p>

<p>Now fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: System.String<CharT>(CharT c) constructor was not explicit, so that a single character may be converted to a string in an unwanted context.
Now fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://slaakko.github.io/cmajor/langref/langref.html#global-variables">Global variables</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now create string literals and arrays of string literals as compile time constants, and obtain the length of a string literal as a compile time constant:</p>

<p>public const char* foo = "foo";
public const long n = foo.Length();
public const char*[] strings = [ "abc", "xyzzy", "foobar" ];
public const long m = strings[2].Length();</p>

<p>The same applies to wchar* and uchar*.</p></li>
<li><p>Unnamed namespaces like in C++. These two declarations with the same the name in two source files do not conflict each other because
they are contained in an unnamed namespace that receives a unique name at compile time:</p>

<p>// alpha.cm:</p>

<p>namespace
{
    const int[] foo = [1, 2, 3];
}</p>

<p>// beta.cm:</p>

<p>namespace
{
    const int[] foo = [2, 3, 4];
}</p>

<p>The mangled name of an unnamed namespace will be "unnamed_ns_UNIQUE_HEX_STRING" where UNIQUE_HEX_STRING will be SHA-1 hash of a random UUID.
The mangled names of the entities belonging to an unnamed namespace will be unique.</p></li>
<li><p>Visual Studio extension updated. It supports now Visual Studio 2019. The cmajor.vsix extension for VS 2019 is in the cmajor/vs/2019 directory.</p></li>
<li><p>System library changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>System.Base library has some additions,
for example a <a href="https://slaakko.github.io/cmajor/system/content/System.Base/doc/class_Timestamp_2B1FF310EF8A16F5D055D85D39E0BC73A373EE7C.html">Timestamp</a> class.</li>
<li>System.Json library has now serialization support for UUID's and timestamps.</li>
<li>APIs of the following libraries have changed because they have been regenerated from C++ code base using the 'cpp2cm' tool and they use new parsing libraries:
<ul>
<li>System.Dom </li>
<li>System.Net.Http</li>
<li>System.Text.RegularExpressions</li>
<li>System.Xml</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New lexing, parsing and AST libraries System.Lex and System.Parsing and Cm.Ast added.
Old  System.Text.Parsing and System.Text.Parsing.CodeDom libraries are now gone, because the new libraries offer superset of their functionality and
duplicate functionality would have made the system library much larger.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>New <a href="https://slaakko.github.io/cmajor/tools/cmupd/cmupd.html">'cmupd'</a>
tool for converting projects and solutions that use old System APIs to use the new APIs.
It's not perfect of course, so some manual changes may be needed.</p></li>
<li><p>All system library parsers and lexers are now generated using the 'soulcm' lexer/parser generator tool.
Each generated lexer is a DFA that has a multimeg Unicode character class map array which is in compressed form inside an executable containing the lexer.
First call to a constructor of some lexer takes a while (about half a second on my machine), because it expands the class map.
Subsequent calls to the same lexer (to a constructor or other member function) are much faster (taking fraction of a millisecond), 
because the class map is already expanded. </p></li>
<li><p>New System.Windows library that is available only on Windows. It is still in preliminary stage.</p></li>
<li><p>System.cms solution file can now be found in the cmajor/system/platform/windows and cmajor/system/platform/linux directories 
for Windows and Linux respectively. The Windows version includes the new System.Windows library.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgraded to LLVM 9.0.0</p></li>
<li><p>Upgraded to Unicode 12.1. </p></li>
</ul>
