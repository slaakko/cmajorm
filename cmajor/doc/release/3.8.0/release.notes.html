<h1>Cmajor 3.8.0 for Windows x64 and Linux</h1>

<h2>Release notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Bug fix (Cmajor Code editor)
Adding lines to the middle of a file that was longer than the screen did not update scroll bars and then you could not scroll to the end of the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix (Cmajor Code editor):
Double clicking last word of text left last character out of selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix (Cmajor Code editor):
Selection with mouse.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance bug fix (Cmajor Code):
Tooltip window handling for the toolbar was done on OnMouseEnter and OnMouseLeave event handlers and done synchronously. It was causing a delay of about 70 ms for each toolbutton on my machine.
Tooltip handling is now moved to OnMouseHover event handler.</p></li>
<li><p>(Cmajor Code editor) Ctrl-A now selects entire text.</p></li>
<li><p>(Cmajor Code editor) Go To Definition: right clicking an identifier in the editor and selecting 'Go To Definition' from the context menu 
locates the editor to the definition location of that symbol. Not perfect. 
This feature requires that you have successfully compiled the project containing the definition and the project in which the identifier resides.</p></li>
